	<h1><em>The Malecón of Mazatlán</em></h1>
	<br>
	The Malecón (<i>boardwalk</i>) of Mazatlán is to be considered one of the longest in the world. Its length is about 8.5 km along the Pacific coast. Along the Malecón are high cliffs, monuments, roundabouts, historical buildings, hotels, etc.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Malecón is composed of a series of roadways with designated space for pedestrians. The names of these roads vary depending on the stage or time of their construction. From south to north, the roads that compose the Malecón are as follow:
	<br>
	<br>
	<i><strong>Calz. Joel Montes Camarena:</strong></i> which connects the lighthouse, which used to be an island, to the rest of the city.
	<br>
	<br>
	<i><strong>Paseo del Centenario:</strong></i> starting in the previous street and bordering the west at the lookout hill where cliffs are seen, it was built to commemorate the centennial of the Independence of Mexico.
	<br>
	<br>
	<i><strong>Paseo Olas Altas:</strong></i> the oldest section of the boardwalk, it was originally a dike to prevent flooding problems in the 1830s, then it became an embankment which was used as urban space, and eventually it became a recreational space. It was the first part of the city with street lighting, and includes the south side of icebox hill and lookout hill.
	<br>
	<br>
	<i><strong>Paseo Claussen:</strong></i> It was built for the centennial in 1910. It borders the icebox hill and ends at the bay of Puerto Viejo. It was named in honor of George Claussen, who was in command of the Mazatlán Works Agency and promoted the centennial project.
	<br>
	<br>
	<i><strong>Avenida del Mar:</strong></i> his is the most representative and longest section of the boardwalk; it extends along the bay of Puerto Viejo and comprises just over half of all the boardwalk. The panoramic tour ends at the tip, which initiates the Golden Zone (the primary hotel zone), and the avenue changes names twice and continues for several kilometers parallel to the coastline, yet maintains some distance from the coastal hotels.
